# Fill
No objective has been coded in the game. You can fill the board with one colour or create a pattern

The game is simple:
- there is a board (3x3 to 25x25)
- Difficulties which determine how many colours you can cycle through
- Different ways to make the pattern (full plus or one plus)

Installation to edit the code
- Download node.js
- To install the dependencies, go to cmd and navigate to the folder with package.json and type 'npm install --save-dev'
- 'npm run build' will compile the code
